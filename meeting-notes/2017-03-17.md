participants:
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Mike Park
 - Adrien Loseille

progress:
- Mike used the evaluation tool [build/run instructions](https://github.com/UGAWG/adapt-results/blob/master/STATS.md) and it gave simular results to the method in refine
- Joshua ran cube-cylinder cases with linear, cilndrical and clindrical modfied with three modes of EPIC. Dan is integrating them into the results repo.
- Dan proposed a modified cube-cylinder benchmark cylindrial metric to remove
   the need to use a gradation-control.
- Mike set up an overleaf project and invite group
- Mike tried the linear cube-cyl metric and is still working on results

action items for next meeting:
- We commit to an IMR paper.

..- overleaf project has outline.

..- sections due in two weeks, 31-mar-2017

..- 02-may-2017 draft for review

..- 30-may-2017 submit

..- 01-sep-2017 final version

discussion:
- Dan apprached the [MMG](http://www.mmgtools.org) group at SIAM about joining
- email discussion about interpolating metric on curved boundaries

..- metric interpolation should be split into tangential and normal components with the tangential part interpolated in parameterized surface coordinates and normal direction possibly reconstructed because hesssian recovery is problematic in normal direction.

..- extrapolation may be implemented to for comparison

- consider more complex geomerty (Adrien has an ONERA M6)
- retropsective: hoping for results sooner, should add BL metric
- the last intex of tetrahedra in meshb format should be a reference to the volume (should be a single number "1")

Next meeting 14:00 UTC 14-apr-2017
