participants:
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Mike Park
 - Nico Barral
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 
progress:
- IMR paper is complete, awaiting Boeing approval
- refine/two and EPIC results updated
- Mike may be able to obtain IMR travel funding. Mike will need to present, if travel funding provided.
- Mike proposed alternative polar-2 metric that is valid inside cylinder for debugging on cube

action items for next meeting:
- Todd and Josh will contact Dan when paper approved
- Dan will upload to IMR
- Mike will contact authors (of other relevant published papers) to invite them to our group
- Mike will create new solution adaptive repo
  - Laminar planar delta wing
  - 3D Hemisphere Cylinder
  - 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Mike will submit an abstract to SciTech-2018 invited special session

special session on Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows at AIAA SciTech-2018:
- Two cases with uniformly refined analytic grids and geometry
  - [3D Hemisphere Cylinder](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html)
  - [3D ONERA M6 Wing](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html)
- Expectation is DOF grid sizes in the 10s of millions; will explore thousands, millions, and 100s of millions
- Should use common solver/solution field to focus on adaptation 
- Examine different solvers/error estimation process separately
- keep solver, error estimation, metric formation, adaptation mechanics as orthogonal as possible
- Mike is planning FV and SFE with Mach hessian and Venditti error estimate
- MIT group may add DG and HDG with MOES

comparisons:
- provide INRIA .solb Mach scalar at nodes, request metric in INRIA .solb at notes
  - hessian recovery
  - gradation control
  - others aspects?
  - how to evaluate? metric conformity, visualize with ellipse, visualize with adapted mesh
- provide INRIA .solb metric, request new grid
  - use evaluation criteria from IMR paper

simpler test cases:
- Euler 3D Hemisphere Cylinder or 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Laminar delta wing [AIAA](http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2292) [NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160006030)
- 3D flat plate
- any of the other [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
- 2D case extruded to unit span with symmetry planes (NACA 0012)

2D test cases:
- first Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows session (NACA 0012 and flat plate)
- see [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases

Next meeting 14:00 UTC 16-june-2017
