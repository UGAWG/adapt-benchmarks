This is where we will distribute the testcases and draft the paper.

- STEP for geometry
- .meshb for grids
- .solb for flow solutions, scalar fields, metric

Plans for IMR 2017 (in decreasing likelihood, items not ready will go in SciTech 2018):

1) revisit 3D analytic metric case from

           Decomposition},
 type   = {AIAA Paper},

}
```

2) create a parametrized ellipsoid in a box with a parametrized metric field. (limits are cylinder and sphere) Share a STEP file and verify that the UV parametrization and NURBS surface is same for all CAD kernels. provide analytic metric

3) left over from paper that was not published, hessian reconstruction (Loseille and Park)

4) Given a .meshb and scalar field .solb compute hessian/metric in .solb

5) solution adaptation ...

6) small step in cad that is smaller than model tolerance, but larger than initial cell height of viscous boundary layer.
