test cases on github
- metric added to cylinder case
results repo created.

What functional to describe "quality" of mesh 
past paper was edge length only

Mike suggested mean ration from Shewchuk Good linear element paper
Dan suggested method
using the vertex metric with largest determinate for cell (in Boeing paper)
alternatives are more costly (tensor log interpolation)
post processing metric should match what is in codes if possible

use other post-processed functionals to determine where they agree and disagree

discussed how to get open source tool for evaluation
omega_h 
pragmatic (petsc)

discussion EGADS for geometry evaluation (and inverse evaluation)

parameterization of the exiting test cases

Dan asked about non manifold geometry with EGADS
participation, keep moving with volunteers we have and hope for more.

Should have minimum necessary for a paper soon.

todo:

All:
Dec meeting proposed (better time for others?)
Dec 14 UTC 14:00
google hangouts again or webex?

All:
add results as available

Park:
mine 2015 paper cases and upload grids to results repo
evaluate grids with paper method.
add solution adaptive cases to new repo

Ibanez: add "quality" evaluation readme
