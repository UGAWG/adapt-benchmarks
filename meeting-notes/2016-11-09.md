Test cases are on github.
- metric added to cylinder case.
- results repo created.

What functional to describe "quality" of mesh?
The past paper was edge length only.

Mike suggested mean ratio from Shewchuk Good linear element paper.
Dan suggested using the vertex metric with largest determinate for cell (in Boeing paper).
Alternatives are more costly (tensor log interpolation).
Post processing metric should match what is in code if possible.

Use other post-processed functionals to determine where they agree and disagree.

Discussed how to get open source tool for evaluation
-omega_h 
-pragmatic (petsc)

Discussion EGADS for geometry evaluation (and inverse evaluation)

Dan asked about non manifold geometry with EGADS

There was a question about participation. Plan is to keep moving with
volunteers we have and hope for more.

We should have minimum necessary for an IMR paper soon.

todo items:

All:
- Dec meeting proposed (better time for others?) Dec 14 UTC 14:00
- Google hangouts again or webex?

All:
- add results as available

Park:
- Mine 2015 paper cases and upload grids to results repo.
- Evaluate grids with paper method.
- Add solution adaptive cases to new repo

Ibanez:
- add "quality" evaluation readme
