1. Nicholas Barral
1. Onkar Sahni
1. Mark Shephard
1. Dan Ibanez
1. Mike Park
1. Adrien Loseille
1. Josh Krakos

Park complete:
- Mine 2015 paper cases and upload grids to results repo.
- Evaluate grids with paper method.

Ibanez complete:
- add "quality" evaluation readme

Discussion of geometry source. STEP seen as common source.

Discussion of initial cube-cylinder mesh being inappropriate. Ibanez
created a new initial mesh with GMSH and added to results repo. New
grid will be adopted in the results section

The analytic metric should be evaluated on the input grid and the
metric interpolated from the input grid during adaptation. This
requires a number of outer iterations to converge the input mesh to
the analytic metric. This is compatible with future solution adaptive
tests. The convergence of outer iteration can also be studied.

Transient meshing was discussed. Interpolation would be the key
ingredient. Other issues (hessian recovery) can also be studied.
