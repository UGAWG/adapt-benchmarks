participants:
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Mark Shephard
 - Onkar Sahni
 - Nico Barral
 - Dan Ibanez

progress:
 - Nico has a cube/linear result, just needs to be uploaded
 - Dan has cube-cylinder "layer" results, but had to modify metric
 - Dan provided an evaluation tool and build/run instructions
 
action items for next meeting:
 - Nico will upload cube/linear result
 - Joshua will run and upload cube/linear, possibly
   also cube-cylinder (both metrics ?)
   
discussion:
 - Dan had to apply gradation control to the cube-cylinder "layer"
   metric to get good quality elements.
 - We all need to be using the same metric
 - Dan proposes we alter the benchmark metric to match
   the gradation-controlled one (not yet agreed upon)
 - discuss some quality evaluation results (cube/linear):
    - feflo.a had best quality (49%)
    - epic-icsm also did well (36%)
    - epic-ic (10%) similar to refine/one (6%)
 - Dan implemented vertex motion, didn't help that much
 - Joshua's vertex motion is pretty expensive
 
 tentatively looking at Feb 24th for next meeting time,
 or somewhere around that time.
